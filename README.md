this is an official app for Hakqlo community. 

# for Developers:
- when you type in indentations, please use "double space" indentation.
  - you can change the setting of indentation in VS Code.
If you don't know how to, ask in our Discord channel.

- We are using Nextjs+React

- when making translation data with JSON files(i.e. en.json, ja.json),
don't use characters like "'", "." or ":" for index keys.
  - if you want to put periods or colons, try things like following:
```json
{
  "Hello he said": "'Hello.' he said."
}
```
## First step

```bash
npm i
```
## TODO
For details, please see our Trello board.
